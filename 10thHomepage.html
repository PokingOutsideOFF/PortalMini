      <p>After completing class 10th , students start worrying about their future, what subjects they should go for in the 11th standard if that will suit them, and so on.</p>
      <p>I believe you aren't an exception either! </p>  
      <p> Have you been aspiring for long to take up science in the eleventh standard? </p> 
      <p> Are you confused now about the subject combination you should go for? I'm sure you are wondering what career opportunities await after completing your high school with science. If you are answering yes to all these questions, pat yourself for coming to the right place. </p>
      
      <h2 id="Sci"><br></h2> 
      <p><h2>The Stream of Science</h2></p>
      <h3>Why Science Stream?</h3>
        <p>The science stream mainly consists of scientific theories and its practical concepts. It helps students to understand the concepts of physics, chemistry and biology with mathematics as its tool which further helps them to develop analytical and problem-solving skills to understand and conquer real time problems of the world.</p>
        <p>It has a broad list of career opportunities, Space Exploration, Data Science, Software Developer, Pharmaceuticals to name a few.</p>
        <p>If man-made marvels, technology, or outer space enchants you or discovering new elements, new medicines and many more things fascinates you then taking science stream would be a smart option.</p>
        </p>
      <h3>Structure of the Stream</h3>  
      <p>It is mostly divided into two sub-streams: PCM (non-medical) and PCM-B (medical).</p>
      <p>Both the streams have physics, chemistry and a language (most probably English) in common. The option between Mathematics and Biology makes the two sub-streams different.
        Biology is generally preferred by those who want to purse their career in medical field, while mathematics is opted by those who generally want to start their career like but not limited to engineering, pilot, statistician, architecture, analyst.</p>   
      <p>Along with the above mandatory subjects, students have to choose an elective subject. Computer Science, Economics, Home Science, Physical Education, Psychology are popular electives.</p>

        <li>
          <b style = "font-size: 20px;">Physics</b>
          <p>Focuses on understanding the functioning of our surroundings.
            In Class 11- 12 it provides an introduction to topics of electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics, mechanics, nuclear physics and solid and liquid state physics.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b style = "font-size: 20px;">Chemistry</b>

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b style = "font-size: 20px;">Mathematics</b>
          <p>Focuses on solving many day-to-day problems and acts as a tool to mostly every subject.
            In Class 11-12 it provides a base for understanding the broad concept of calculus, algebra, vectors, linear programming, 3D geometry and probability.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b style = "font-size: 20px;">Biology</b>
          <p>Focuses on studying living organisms, their living mechanisms, chemical processes and evolution.
            In Class 11-12 it provides in-depth understanding of human and plant physiology, genetics, evolution and provides a connection with real-life technology, environment, agriculture and industry.
